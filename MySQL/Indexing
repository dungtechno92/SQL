1. Types of Indexes:
  1.1. B-Tree indexes:
    - Kinds of queries: 
      + Match the full value.
      + Match a leftmost prefix.
      + Match a column prefix.
      + Match a range of values.
      + Match one part exactly and match a range on another part.
      + Index-only queries.
    - Limitations: 
      + Not useful if the lookup does not start from the leftmost side of the indexed.
      + Can’t skip columns in the index(when use index for multi columns).
      + The storage engine can’t optimize accesses with any columns to the right of the
      first range condition.
   1.2. Hash indexes:
    - Limitations:
      + Can't use the values in the index to avoid reading the rows.
      + Can't use hash indexes for sorting.
      + Hash indexes don’t support partial key matching.
      + Hash indexes support only equality comparisons.
      + Some index maintenace operations can be slow if there are many hash collisions.
    - Adaptive hash indexes( TODO).
